    <h1>Fun with CSS</h1>

    <p>The goal of this page is to practice using different CSS elements.  We will explore the use of classes, divs, spans, floats, and more. One of the difficulties of developing web pages to practice on is coming up with content to present. It may not end up being the prettiest site, but it will be good practice.</p>

    <p>Classes are the first element that we will be presenting.  A class is used in CSS to effect specific sections of the presentation.  More specifically you can tag a specific paragraph or and of the html without effecting every section of the same type.</p>

    <p class="example1">This simple paragraph will look different from the paragraph above it as it will be marked by a "class" tag and given a specific name.


    <p>This next section will be filled with several paragraphs of jibbersh, then effected by a div.</p>

    <div class="divexample">
      <p> since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

      <p class="exception">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <span class="name">Richard McClintock</span>,a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>

      <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
